# Project-DecoderRing
The Decoder Ring app allows users to encode and decode messages by using various ciphers: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or the Substitution Cipher. When building this application, I applied the test-driven development approach and wrote a series of unit tests with Mocha and Chai to test the complex algorithms.
